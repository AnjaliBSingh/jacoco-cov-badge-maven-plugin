# Jacoco Coverage Badge Maven Plugin

![build](status/build.svg)

> WIP

Jacoco is code coverage utility which generates nice report for
Java Based projects and is generally integrated as maven build plugin.

`Badges` are like the one you are seeing above, which represents `build` status.
There are several online utilities like `coveralls`, `shields.io` etc. which
provides badges as a service.

## Why?

None of the utilities mentioned above solves the problem of generating local
badges esp. for `Java` projects. There were few attempts in the past but they
were not satisfactory.

## What it does?

It's a `maven` plugin, which if included as part of build then will generate
an `svg`,`png` or `jpg` coverage badges based on user configuration.

It reads the coverage report generated by `jacoco` and generates a local badge,
which can then be included in any `.md` files.

> It is highly inspired from `gh-badges` which `shields.io` also uses for
> generating badges.

More documentation and features coming soon...
